# bike_image_classifier_tensorflow

This readme was auto-generated using [whisk](https://github.com/whisk-ml/whisk). whisk creates a logical and flexible project structure for ML with reproducible results and lets you release your model to the world without becoming a software engineer.

Once your project is setup, edit this readme directly to add context and documentation for your project.

## Prerequisites

The following is required to run this project:

* Git (configured with a [user name and email](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup))
